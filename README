COSC481 - Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity Orphanages project

The Handmaids site is based on WordPress. We're going to create a custom theme for the site
so we're putting the entire site under version control. In order to keep the db under version
control, we can save dumps from MySQL at times.

---MySQL setup---
1) Install MySQL
2) Add an environment path variable for mysql
	Ex: C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.12\bin;
3) In Git Bash/Command line navigate to the MySQL folder in handmaids and start MySQL
	Ex: Navigate to C:\Users\vpeker\COSC481\handmaids\mysql
	Ex: mysql -u root
4) run the following to create the user and db:
Ex:

create database wp_handmaids;
create user handmaids@'localhost' identified by "handmaids";
grant all privileges on wp_handmaids.* to handmaids;

This creates the user 'handmaids' with the password 'handmaids' and creates the wordpress database we'll be using.

5) Exit mysql by typing in 'exit'

6) setup the database using the init.sql script in the mysql directory.
Ex:

mysql -h localhost -u handmaids -p wp_handmaids < init.sql


---Apache setup---

1) Add an entry for the wordpress root directory into the Apache configuration. 
If using WAMP, click on the wamp icon in the taskbar, browse to Apache and open httpd.conf. Find these two lines and uncomment the second line by removing the #.

# Virtual hosts
# Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Open httpd-vhosts.conf in C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.4.4\conf\extra and add the code below at the bottom of the file. Replace paths for DocumentRoom, ErrorLog, CustomLog with the path on your computer to the folders in the example.
Ex:

 <VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	ServerName handmaids-local

	DocumentRoot /home/matt/documents/cosc481/handmaids/wordpress

	ErrorLog /home/matt/documents/cosc481/handmaids/error.log

	# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
	# alert, emerg.
	LogLevel debug

	CustomLog /home/matt/documents/cosc481/handmaids/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>

2) start or restart Apache. If using WAMP, click on the icon in the taskbar and click on 'Restart All Services'
Ex:

sudo apache2ctl stop
sudo apache2ctl start

3) add an entry in the local hosts file (/etc/hosts). On Windows, the file is C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts. 
The name you put here needs to match the ServerName value in the Apache config.
Ex:
127.0.0.1	handmaids-local 

4) Hit the host above from your browser (http://handmaids-local/) and you should see the
Wordpress site.
