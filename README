COSC481 - Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity Orphanages project

The Handmaids site is based on WordPress. We're going to create a custom theme for the site
so we're putting the entire site under version control. In order to keep the db under version
control, we can save dumps from MySQL at times.

---MySQL setup---
1) install MySQL and start it 
2) run the following to create the user and db:

create database wp_handmaids;
create user handmaids identified by "handmaids";
grant all privileges on wp_handmaids.* to handmaids;

This creates the user handmaids with the password handmaids and create the wordpress database we'll be using.


---Apache setup---

1) Add an entry for the wordpress root directory into the Apache configuration.
Ex:

 <VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	ServerName handmaids-local

	DocumentRoot /home/matt/documents/cosc481/handmaids/wordpress

	ErrorLog /home/matt/documents/cosc481/handmaids/error.log

	# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
	# alert, emerg.
	LogLevel debug

	CustomLog /home/matt/documents/cosc481/handmaids/access.log combined

</VirtualHost>

2) start or restart Apache
Ex:

sudo apache2ctl stop
sudo apache2ctl start

3) add an entry in the local hosts file (/etc/hosts). The name you put here needs to match
the ServerName value in the Apache config.
Ex:
127.0.0.1	handmaids-local 

4) Hit the host above from your browser (http://handmaids-local/) and you should see the
Wordpress site.
