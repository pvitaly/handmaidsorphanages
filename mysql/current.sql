Or, if you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.9\">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

(And be sure to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112\">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785\">#21785</a>)</li>\n<li>We brought 3.8&#8242;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055\">#27055</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor.

(<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959\">#26959</a>)</li>\n<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them.

(<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845\">#19845</a>)</li>\n<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>.

(You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003\">#27003</a>.</li>\n<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663\">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272\">#25272</a>).</li>\n<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799\">#26799</a>).

Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2856\" style=\"margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0\" alt=\"about-modern-wordpress\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2984\" alt=\"responsive\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2954\" alt=\"colors\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2967\" alt=\"themes\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789\" alt=\"The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7\">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7\">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">on the make/core blog</a>.

Stats are now a native component, improving their look and feel on devices running iOS. While I didn&#8217;t have a problem with the traditional web view, the native view is a considerable improvement. Being a native component has also given the stats a noticeable speed improvement when loading.</p>\n<p>Prior to upgrading, my WordPress app started to show me connected to the same site multiple times. I also encountered an issue where the comment notification bubble wouldn&#8217;t reset to zero. Instead, it kept rising. Upgrading to 4.0 fixed both problems. The team says <a title=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues?milestone=15&state=open\" href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues?milestone=15&state=open\">4.0.1</a> is dedicated to the cleanup of code, bug fixes, and minor tweaks. This will pave the way for the team to tackle media management in 4.1.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve upgraded to 4.0, let us know what you think.

OSTraining was launched in 2008 and is one of the few websites dedicated to educating users of three major open-source platforms: <strong>Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress</strong>. Through OSTraining, Steve has a unique perspective on the pain points users are encountering with each platform.</p>\n<p>We talked about the future of WordPress as well as the move towards front-end editing. Will it help users edit their content without having to navigate the back-end of WordPress or will it cause more confusion? Burge introduced us to his new <a href=\"http://www.ostraining.com/blog/general/wics/\" title=\"http://www.ostraining.com/blog/general/wics/\">WICS system</a> (Words Ideas Clicks Screens) aimed at determining which platform is easier to use based on a common set of tasks. WordPress scored well, especially with the task of organizing content.

WordPress was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-accepted-as-a-mentoring-organization-for-google-summer-of-code-2014\" target=\"_blank\">accepted as a mentoring organization</a> for Google Summer of Code 2014. As part of that process, the community prepared a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014\" target=\"_blank\">list of ideas for GSoC projects</a> that students can work on. The creation of a WordCamp mobile app was among those ideas.</p>\n<p>The application would be intended for use by attendees who can download it to have the event schedule and details at their fingertips. Jen Mylo <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/03/21/wordcamp-mobile-app-we-put-it-on-the/\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> today on the Make WordPress Community blog, seeking input on features, as a handful of students have already demonstrated interest in the project. &#8220;Without going too crazy, and remembering this is a summer job for one college student, what would make sense to include?&#8221; she asked.</p>\n<p>Mylo offered a few preliminary ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the info that’s on the WC site in standardized format (location/map, schedule, etc)</li>\n<li>Ability to rate sessions/speakers</li>\n<li>Follow Twitter mentions and official hashtag in one stream and/or full tagregator stream</li>\n<li>Push notifications (opt-in) based on organizer posts to [blog? a cpt? something else?] to notify of day-of time-sensitive things like lunch being served, closing remarks starting, lost laptop, etc.</li>\n<li>Take the follow up survey once event is over</li>\n<li>Check in/out of event?</li>\n<li>Form to contact on-site organizers (emergency, safety, code of conduct, lost and found, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dustin Filippini <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/03/21/wordcamp-mobile-app-we-put-it-on-the/#comment-8291\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the post to suggest additional ideas for features, including comprehensive location information for the venue, any after parties, suggested hotels, parking, restaurants, etc.</p>\n<p>Many WordCampers, having made a great effort to travel to an event, are eager to get the most out of it. Missing an announcement about an after party or other related gatherings would a pity.

Visitors can upload themes and templates and the service will analyze the files and run tests to verify security and code quality. The site gives each theme a quality score along with a list of alerts and warnings.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive\" target=\"_blank\">Responsive</a> theme, which has been popular on WordPress.org, gets a <a href=\"http://themecheck.org/score/wordpress_theme_responsive.html\" target=\"_blank\">validation of 95%</a>.  Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/circa\" target=\"_blank\">Circa</a> theme <a href=\"http://themecheck.org/score/wordpress_theme_circa.html\" target=\"_blank\">validates 100%</a>. Critical alerts can bring a theme down to a zero validation score.</p>\n<p>The site displays scores for recently checked themes, both free and commercial:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/themecheck.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19467]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/themecheck.jpg\" alt=\"themecheck\" width=\"1084\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19500\" /></a></p>\n<p>ThemeCheck.org creates a badge for each theme to display its validation score and link back to the report. Theme authors or sites that distribute themes and templates can embed the badges on their websites.</p>\n<p>The validation service uses a forked version of the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Check</a> plugin to validate themes. This plugin allows WordPress theme developers to make sure their themes are up to the latest <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review\" target=\"_blank\">theme review</a> standards. It&#8217;s the same tool used for automated testing of new themes submitted to the WordPress Themes Directory.</p>\n<p>After finding that the service was not able to accurately score WordPress child themes, I spoke with Guillaume Baudhuin, the site&#8217;s creator. He responded to my concerns by updating the validation service in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the score calculation algorithm. It is more severe with critical alerts counting for -20% and Warnings counting for -1%.</li>\n<li>Some critical alerts were downgraded to warnings (in checks for screenshots, metadata, etc.)</li>\n<li>Child themes are managed correctly. Some checks no longer apply to child themes.</li>\n<li>Improved management of template overrides</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that the service would have problems with child themes, since it uses a fork of the Theme Check plugin. Unfortunately this plugin doesn&#8217;t accurately account for child themes and will throw a bunch of warnings that often do not apply. I&#8217;d be curious to know if ThemeCheck.org&#8217;s changes regarding child themes could be applied to the original Theme Check plugin.</p>\n<h3>A Useful Tool for Consumers Shopping for WordPress Themes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/validation-score.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19467]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/validation-score.jpg\" alt=\"validation-score\" width=\"231\" height=\"308\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-19516\" /></a>The team at ThemeCheck.org seems dedicated to providing the most accurate validations possible, given their attentive response to concerns raised by their users. Scrolling through the recent results you can see that most of the themes are free, but there are a few commercial themes peppered throughout.</p>\n<p>While anyone can validate a WordPress theme using the Theme Check plugin, many don&#8217;t want the hassle. This service makes it convenient for anyone to perform a validation. If you use it to validate a theme and you don&#8217;t want it to store any information about the theme&#8217;s score, you can select that option when uploading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://themecheck.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeCheck.org</a> could potentially be a very useful site for consumers who are shopping for WordPress themes, if more commercial themes are added. It empowers non-technical consumers to approach theme developers about the critical warnings discovered through the validation tool. In the future, the team plans to add an option to sort themes by score, i.e. to display all themes that score 100%.</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback about the service or want to inspect the code it uses to perform validations, ThemeCheck.org is <a href=\"https://github.com/themecheck/themecheck\" target=\"_blank\">open source and hosted on github</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 20:03:45

In addition to entering your text-based username and password, this plugin adds a graphic password for the site administrator.</p>\n<p>After you install the plugin, the settings page allows you to select an image and then add your password using your mouse or finger, in the case of mobile devices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graphic-password.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19436]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19446\" alt=\"graphic-password\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graphic-password.jpg\" width=\"1170\" height=\"618\" /></a></p>\n<p>After your password is set, the login page will require your graphic password as well as your original text-based username/password combination. If either one is omitted, you will not be permitted to enter the site. The lock button must be toggled open in order to reveal the graphic password entry, which is a further advantage against bots that are only trained to go after the traditional login form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graphic-password-login.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19436]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19447\" alt=\"graphic-password-login\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graphic-password-login.jpg\" width=\"646\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p>The only way to crack this method is if the hacker employs a machine trained on heuristic attacks against graphic password interfaces. This is certainly not as common as attacks on text-based authentication. Combine the two methods and your average nefarious bot is going to have to be smart as hell to get through.</p>\n<p>Is this as strong as multi-factor authentication? Probably not. Generally two-factor authentication for WordPress utilizes the &#8220;something you have&#8221; requirement by asking you to produce a verification code from your phone. If you cannot be bothered with this or simply don&#8217;t have your phone on you at all times, then the graphic password might be a good alternative for you.</p>\n<p>I tested WP Graphic Admin Password and found it to work as advertised. It is a simple and convenient tool for adding a higher level of security to your WordPress site. It is especially useful if you frequently access your site from a public, possibly infected, computer that might be logging text-based passwords. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-graphic-password/\" target=\"_blank\">Download WP Graphic Admin Password</a> for free from WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Update:</h3>\n<p><strong>The plugin was removed from the repository due security violations but will be back in the WordPress repository after it passes a second review.

When 2.0 is released with signup management built in, anyone using this plugin with BuddyPress will no longer need it.</p>\n<p>Signup management could use more testing, as it makes a few changes to the way signups are handled in the database. Multisite installations are usually the only ones with a signups table. With this change to BuddyPress signup administration, all signups will be stored in the $wpdb->signups table, even on single site installations.</p>\n<p>This enhancement, in addition to the ability to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-to-add-profile-editing-in-the-wordpress-admin\" target=\"_blank\">edit profiles in the admin</a>, will make BuddyPress community management much easier for administrators. If you want to check out the new signup management features, grab a copy of <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress 2.0-bleeding edge</a> and give it a test drive. It&#8217;s not as bloody as it sounds. In fact, the new features are working fairly smoothly already but the core team can always use more help in testing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 20:57:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WordPress.tv: Natalie MacLees: Defining Your User Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/20/natalie-maclees-defining-your-user-experience/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:669:\"<div id=\"v-gB27KMj0-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33248/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33248/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33248&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/20/natalie-maclees-defining-your-user-experience/\"><img alt=\"Natalie MacLees: Defining Your User Experience\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/gB27KMj0/video-9ebc0c1115_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 19:27:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: CreativeMarket Acquired By The Makers Of AutoCAD\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19380\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"http://wptavern.com/creativemarket-acquired-by-the-makers-of-autocad?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=creativemarket-acquired-by-the-makers-of-autocad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2482:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CreativeMarketlogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19380]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-19381\" alt=\"CreativeMarket Logo\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CreativeMarketlogo.png\" width=\"159\" height=\"97\" /></a>CreativeMarket, one of the first WordPress theme marketplaces to fully support the GPL license <a title=\"https://creativemarket.com/blog/2014/03/19/building-the-worlds-marketplace-for-design\" href=\"https://creativemarket.com/blog/2014/03/19/building-the-worlds-marketplace-for-design\">has been acquired</a> by <a title=\"http://www.autodesk.com/\" href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/\">Autodesk</a>, for an undisclosed amount.

Pantheon provides a scalable web platform with devops-friendly dashboards and tools for deployment and management.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first and most obvious thing we did was ensure the platform was WordPress-friendly. This is the only piece of work that wasn’t on our roadmap already, but luckily it wasn’t very hard. The requirements for running Drupal vs. WordPress are quite similar.</p>\n<p>The upside is that WordPress developers can expect tuned and friendly configurations for php, nginx, Varnish, mysql and Redis, with a stock set of Plugins to make the most of everything the platform has to offer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/wordpress-developers-rejoice-pantheon-has-your-back\">WordPress Developers Rejoice! Pantheon Has Your Back</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, Pantheon already had a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool called Terminus for managing services, which they originally implemented as a drush extension (drush is the &#8220;drupal shell&#8221;, a CLI for Drupal). In modifying their platform for WordPress support, they rewrote it as a stand-alone tool, borrowing a lot of ideas from wp-cli in the process.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We actually borrowed quite a lot from the wp-cli toolkit in this refactor. Our library code was largely portable from Drush, but we took their object structure and docstring-parsing magic, which is pretty strong stuff. As a result, we have a more robust CLI tool to build off in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested, <a href=\"https://www.getpantheon.com/pricing\">they offer a free account</a> to let you check things out (no custom domain on the free level). Paid offerings begin at just $25/month.</p>\n<p>(I have no affiliation with Pantheon, if anyone is wondering)</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/19/pantheon-platform-adds-wordpress-support/\">Pantheon Platform Adds WordPress Support</a><br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org\">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none\">\n<img src=\"http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130\" alt=\"YARPP\" />\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 02:43:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Dougal Campbell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Alex King: I’m live now on the DradCast – tune in!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://alexking.org/?p=19686\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2014/03/19/19686\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"<div>\n<p>I&#8217;m live now on the <a href=\"http://dradcast.com/\">DradCast</a> &#8211; tune in!</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:00:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Alex\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Formally Opens Its Marketplace to Theme Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19204\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:192:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-formally-opens-its-marketplace-to-theme-developers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-com-formally-opens-its-marketplace-to-theme-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12670:\"<p>In 2011, <a title=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/introducing-premium-themes/\" href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/introducing-premium-themes/\">WordPress.com </a>began offering commercial themes to its users.

Chris Wallace, founder of UpThemes told me WordPress.com is its largest source of income. The company has experience exponential growth since launching its latest theme, <a title=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/photolia/\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/photolia/\">Photolia,</a> in December of last year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19308\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PhotoliaByUpThemes.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19204]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-19308\" alt=\"Photolia By UpThemes\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PhotoliaByUpThemes-500x319.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photolia By UpThemes</p></div>\n<p>When UpThemes <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/upthemes-publishes-open-letter-sounds-wakeup-call-to-other-wordpress-theme-shops\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/upthemes-publishes-open-letter-sounds-wakeup-call-to-other-wordpress-theme-shops\">published its open letter</a> to the community back in February, one thing was clear. The company would no longer create themes filled with options, shortcodes, and sliders. The open letter was the company&#8217;s renewed commitment to keeping things simple. As it turns out, their new focus on simplicity is aligned with how themes are created on WordPress.com.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we relaunched UpThemes, one of the main goals was to make it extremely easy to get up and running with our themes. WordPress.com lines up perfectly with that strategy. It allows us to sell, distribute, and update our themes very easily, ensuring that all customers are running the current version of each theme and have not made destructive changes that would render future updates unusable. This is the absolute best scenario for both our customers and our team.</p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_19328\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/YumblogOnWPdotComByUpthemes.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19204]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19328\" alt=\"Yumblog On WordPress.com By UpThemes\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/YumblogOnWPdotComByUpthemes.png\" width=\"587\" height=\"440\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yumblog On WordPress.com By UpThemes</p></div>\n<p>I asked Wallace what advice does he have for theme authors wanting to sell themes on WordPress.com. He said, &#8220;You should bring your best design skills because these premium themes can’t be overblown with shortcodes, widgets, custom post types, and option frameworks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Themes on WordPress.com don&#8217;t have the luxury of having a million options and according to Wallace, customers don&#8217;t want those types of themes, &#8220;Bloggers don’t care about options, they care about getting noticed and making an impact. They don’t need 40 alternate homepage templates, they need a theme that makes a bold statement and works flawlessly&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Wallace is excited to see the marketplace open up and wants to see more theme authors join in. &#8220;I look forward to seeing more theme authors jump on board with WordPress.com because it would validate our thought that simplicity is the correct path for themes in 2014&#8243;.</p>\n<h3>MH Themes Has A Positive Impact On Sales</h3>\n<p>Michael Hebenstreit is the founder of <a title=\"http://www.mhthemes.com/\" href=\"http://www.mhthemes.com/\">MHThemes.com,</a> a company with the goal of creating magazine type themes which are suitable for News Websites, Online Magazines and other editorial Projects. MH Themes only sells one theme on WordPress.com called <a title=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/mh-magazine/\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/mh-magazine/\">MH Magazine</a> but Hebenstreit told me it&#8217;s done very well for the company.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19311\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MHMagazineTheme.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19204]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-19311\" alt=\"MH Magazine by MH Themes\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MHMagazineTheme-500x313.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"313\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">MH Magazine by MH Themes</p></div>\n<p>He said, &#8220;Selling on WordPress.com has had a positive impact on theme sales&#8221;. Since WordPress.com only has 250 themes available with 105 being commercial, it&#8217;s more likely users will notice a commercial theme. When asked how difficult it was to join, Hebenstreit replied, &#8220;The team behind <a href=\"http://WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a> is amazing, provide great support and do their best to help you launch your theme on <a href=\"http://WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a>.&#8221;<br />\nHebenstreit offers this advice to new sellers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My advice to potential theme sellers on <a href=\"http://WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a> is to provide something unique which isn’t available yet. Due to the fact that there currently are not many themes available, unique items are still possible and will sell better.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Not As Hard As You Think To Sell Themes On WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>Sami Keijonen who runs <a title=\"https://foxnet-themes.fi/\" href=\"https://foxnet-themes.fi/\">FoxnetThemes.com</a> recently <a title=\"https://foxnet-themes.fi/2014/03/13/becoming-a-theme-author-in-wordpress-com/\" href=\"https://foxnet-themes.fi/2014/03/13/becoming-a-theme-author-in-wordpress-com/\">published his story</a> describing what it was like to go through the process of becoming a theme seller on WordPress.com. There are a lot of interesting tidbits from his story such as <a title=\"http://developer.wordpress.com/themes/\" href=\"http://developer.wordpress.com/themes/\">what&#8217;s discouraged</a> from being used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS Frameworks</li>\n<li>Theme Frameworks</li>\n<li>Shortcodes</li>\n<li>Widgets</li>\n<li>Custom post types</li>\n<li>Metaboxes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He also includes some educational information on how to properly escape strings, remove defaults, and using the theme customizer. While I initially thought it would be difficult to sell a theme on WordPress.com, Keijonen&#8217;s experience proves it&#8217;s not as hard as I thought.</p>\n<h3>Advice From An Automattic Theme Wrangler</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickHamze\">@NickHamze</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacManXcom\">@MacManXcom</a> so, this happened. <a href=\"http://t.co/DJ0uEuWrpZ\">pic.twitter.com/DJ0uEuWrpZ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Karen Arnold (@karenalma) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenalma/statuses/444545838757339136\">March 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I asked Automattic Theme Wrangler, Ian Stewart, what advice would he tell sellers before submitting an application.

While basing your theme on Underscores may raise the odds of being selected to be part of the WordPress.com marketplace, it&#8217;s not a requirement.</p>\n<h3>Open Registration Will Hasten The Trend Of Simplifying Themes</h3>\n<p>During the past few months, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/justin-tadlock-publishes-the-results-of-his-themeforest-experiment\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/justin-tadlock-publishes-the-results-of-his-themeforest-experiment\">we&#8217;ve written about</a> the trend of WordPress theme authors creating simpler themes without <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-shops-move-towards-preserving-data-portability\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-shops-move-towards-preserving-data-portability\">locking users in</a> through the use of shortcodes, custom post types, etc. These are the types of themes perfectly suited to be sold on WordPress.com. Opening registration will hasten the trend of which the entire WordPress community will benefit.</p>\n<h3>ThemeForest and WordPress.com Have A Potential Customer Base That Is Unmatched</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons theme authors use ThemeForest is the size of its audience. Until now, it was the place to go to sell themes to the widest possible audience. Since WordPress.com <a title=\"http://en.wordpress.com/stats/\" href=\"http://en.wordpress.com/stats/\">hosts over 76 million websites</a>,  that&#8217;s 76 million potential customers all in one place. However, nothing stops sellers from utilizing both marketplaces as WordPress.com requires no exclusivity to sell on its platform.</p>\n<p>ThemeForest and WordPress.com give sellers the chance to have their products in front of millions of people. This is an audience that even the most popular commercial theme companies can&#8217;t match. In fact, companies like <a title=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/studiopress/\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/studiopress/\">StudioPress</a>, <a title=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/the-theme-foundry/\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/the-theme-foundry/\">The Theme Foundry</a>, and <a title=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/woothemes/\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/woothemes/\">WooThemes</a> are already benefiting from being listed on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to <a title=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/join/\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/join/\">submit your request</a> to WordPress.com. There are few opportunities to sell WordPress themes to a relevant audience of millions without having a huge marketing campaign. Currently, commercial theme authors would be competing against less than 300 themes. Since sellers can determine the price and keep 50% of the sale, not doing so seems like it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense.</p>\n<p>If selling themes is not your cup of tea, consider <a title=\"http://automattic.com/work-with-us/\" href=\"http://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">putting in a job application</a> to be a <a title=\"http://automattic.com/work-with-us/theme-wrangler/\" href=\"http://automattic.com/work-with-us/theme-wrangler/\">theme wrangler</a> for Automattic.

Designed by Alexandru Cosmin, JustWrite nicely displays featured posts, categories and widgets without making your eyes bleed. Many publications are afflicted with a claustrophobia-inducing layout that causes readers to abandon the page after it loads. The JustWrite theme, however, achieves that coveted balance between space and content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/justwrite.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19312]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/justwrite.png\" alt=\"justwrite\" width=\"880\" height=\"660\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19351\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Customizing JustWrite</h3>\n<p>This theme packs an impressive number of options into WordPress&#8217; native customizer, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custom Header</strong> &#8211; Specify logo image/font color, background image/color, and header border color</li>\n<li><strong>Top Menu</strong> &#8211; Enable/disable fixed positioning, customize border and background colors</li>\n<li><strong>Top Menu Colors</strong> &#8211; Specify link and hover colors</li>\n<li><strong>Global</strong> &#8211; Customize global background, border, link and font colors</li>\n<li><strong>Typography</strong> &#8211; Select from four font families</li>\n<li><strong>Mini Sidebar Configuration</strong> &#8211; Set featured menus</li>\n<li><strong>Site Text</strong> &#8211; Customize footer, site title, tagline text</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a few changes in the customizer, you can easily alter the theme to have a dark design, if you choose:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/justwrite-dark.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19312]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/justwrite-dark.jpg\" alt=\"justwrite-dark\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1121\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19362\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to all the options built into the customizer, JustWrite has its own options page for configuring the slider, adding a favicon, adding social buttons, setting up advertising and enabling the author box.</p>\n<p>One particularly awesome thing about the <a href=\"http://demo.acosmin.com/?theme=acosminblogger\" target=\"_blank\">JustWrite demo</a> is that it contains a live example for virtually every permutation of the options, i.e. examples with mini-sidebar disabled, <a href=\"http://demo.acosmin.com/themes/acosminblogger/header-background-img/\" target=\"_blank\">header background image enabled</a>, <a href=\"http://demo.acosmin.com/themes/acosminblogger/index-example/\" target=\"_blank\">dark colors</a>, all available font styles, <a href=\"http://demo.acosmin.com/themes/acosminblogger/fixed-menu/\" target=\"_blank\">fixed menu disabled</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>JustWrite includes support for Font Awesome icons, multiple sidebars and page templates, as well as a host of widgets tailored for magazines: featured, popular and recent posts, latest tweets, and advertising.

After <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/a-quick-look-at-1-7-theme-compatibility/\" target=\"_blank\">theme compatibility</a> was introduced, effectively making BuddyPress able to work with nearly any WordPress theme, the market slowed its production of new products tailored specifically for BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>When you see a theme that highlights BuddyPress features in a big way, it&#8217;s worth taking note. <a href=\"http://www.gavick.com/wordpress-themes/m-social,135.html\" target=\"_blank\">(M) Social</a> is one such theme from the folks at <a href=\"http://www.gavick.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GavickPro</a>. Although new to the WordPress theme space, the GavickPro team is well established in the Joomla community with more than seven years of design experience.</p>\n<p>(M) Social puts the BuddyPress activity component in the spotlight with its grid style image header.

I spoke to GavickPro&#8217;s consumer support specialist, Lee Batten, about the choice to support rtMedia. The Joomla version of the (M) Social theme is built for <a href=\"http://www.jomsocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JomSocial</a> which has support for images and photo uploads. Batten said they wanted to make sure that their BuddyPress version included this feature.</p>\n<blockquote><p>BuddyPress has no support for image galleries, yet galleries are an important part of social websites. We researched many similar plugins, and rtMedia seemed to be the simplest solution to achieve the effect required; it&#8217;s smoothly integrated with BuddyPress and allows users to upload media files from the front-end and sort them into albums, plus it has privacy controls and it&#8217;s responsive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Including rtMedia support gave the team the freedom to design with gallery images in mind. It also provided the opportunity for them to create an additional BP Latest Photos widget to display community images posted to the activity stream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/latest-pictures-widget.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19273]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/latest-pictures-widget.jpg\" alt=\"latest-pictures-widget\" width=\"716\" height=\"348\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19285\" /></a></p>\n<p>GavickPro is a good example of the trend for companies building themes around third-party plugins. Batten said, <strong>&#8220;Our experience in theme development in general has taught us that support for popular third-party extensions is extremely important and can make a theme much more attractive to customers.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>However, this approach isn&#8217;t without its unique challenges. For example, as it relates to the (M) Social theme, the team behind rtMedia release updates often. &#8220;On the one hand this is great for users, as these updates fix issues or add new features,&#8221; Batten said. &#8220;But often we must make some CSS changes to the theme after any updates to maintain the overall &#8216;feel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keeping themes updated to support new versions of third-party extensions is a normal part of GavickPro&#8217;s maintenance process, but it&#8217;s also the most challenging, as their customers also have to update their themes more often to keep pace with the plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, small plugins don&#8217;t usually have public beta or RC versions so there&#8217;s no way to ensure the theme is compatible with the update in advance,&#8221; Batten said. &#8220;Instead we must wait til after the update is released.&#8221; This is undoubtedly a struggle shared by many other WordPress theme shops that support smaller plugins with no public betas.</p>\n<h3>Competing in Both the Joomla and WordPress Theme Markets</h3>\n<p>The GavickPro team specializes in creating social themes, which is what attracted them to BuddyPress in the first place. Batten says that demand for social themes continues to grow. &#8220;According to our stats, our social themes are on the upper end of the scale with regards to popularity, alongside our e-commerce templates.&#8221; He believes that this category is on the rise. <strong>&#8220;Social interaction is now a cornerstone of most users&#8217; internet experience and the ability to share and discuss can really make the difference if you&#8217;re trying to build a community.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the company originally started out as a Joomla-exclusive theme shop and are more well-known in that space, their WordPress theme sales are growing at a faster rate than the Joomla themes. &#8220;Last year WordPress accounted for only one-tenth of our total sales, but currently they account for one-third, which is quite a major jump!&#8221;</p>\n<p>GavickPro started developing WordPress themes a year ago, after recognizing the opportunity, but it&#8217;s more of an uphill climb to get noticed in this space. <strong>&#8220;The WordPress market dwarfs Joomla&#8217;s, so it has been challenging to achieve a degree of market penetration,&#8221;</strong> Batten said. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much information and competition out there that even great designs can sadly go unnoticed, especially from unfamiliar developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even so, the team at GavickPro is off to an excellent start with its unique BuddyPress themes. The theme framework and all of the widgets are open source and free to download from the <a href=\"https://github.com/GavickPro\" target=\"_blank\">GavickPro Github account.</a> They&#8217;re working on adding the widgets to the WordPress Plugin Directory as well.

Many commonly-used applications have partnered with them to integrate data, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pocket, Pinterest, IFFFT, Mixcloud, Soundcloud, and others.</p>\n<p>Developers who want to integrate with WordPress.com can do so via its <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a>, which provides endpoints for tapping into Publishing, Stats, Likes, Notifications, Insights, Reader and more. The docs include query parameters and an example query/response for each endpoint.</p>\n<p>In addition to the updated REST API documentation, a few extra highlights from the docs include:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oembed-provider-api/\" target=\"_blank\">oEmbed Provider API</a>:</strong><br />\nThe Developer Site has information about the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oembed-provider-api/\" target=\"_blank\">oEmbed Provider API</a>, which enables you to embed any post, page and attachment hosted on WordPress.com or via Jetpack.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/sharing-buttons/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing Button Creation</a>:</strong><br />\nDevelopers can find information on adding new buttons to WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/sharing/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing</a> buttons. If you have a service that is not currently supported, there is a step-by-step guide for triggering the service creation process for a user.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/embedded-timelines/\" target=\"_blank\">Embedded Timelines</a>:</strong><br />\nThe site includes a dedicated page for helping users create <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/timeline-creation/\" target=\"_blank\">embeddable timelines</a>. The timeline generator gives you a single line of code for displaying recent posts on any site. It works for both WordPress.com blogs and Jetpack blogs with the JSON API feature enabled.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Guide</a>:</strong><br />\nTheme developers who are interested in building for WordPress.com will be delighted to discover the newly-designed <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Guide</a>, which includes information on escaping data, internationalization, queries, how to properly enqueue scripts and styles, data portability and everything else you need to know about developing a theme to meet WordPress.com standards.</p>\n<h3>Automattic is Putting a Higher Priority on Developer Resources</h3>\n<p>With the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AutomatticEng\" target=\"_blank\">@AutomatticEng</a> Twitter account and an updated developer site, Automattic is putting developer resources and communication on a higher priority. Kudish said that this is the result of new initiatives to help developers. &#8220;In November 2013 we formed a new team at Automattic under the leadership of Raanan Bar-Cohen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This team is focused on third-party integrations with WordPress.com and Jetpack. Part of what we work on are these initiatives to promote our development resources and APIs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With WordPress now powering more than 21% of the web, it&#8217;s critical that developers have easy access to information on integrating with WordPress.com, which makes up a large chunk of that 21%. Much of the information on the new <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">Developer Site</a> was already available in one form or another, but the documentation is now better designed and easier to navigate. In the future, the team plans to add forums to help developers find answers and interact with one another. For now, the best way to get in touch is via the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">contact form</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AutomatticEng\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 23:24:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WordPress.tv: Chris Lema and Steve Zehngut: Pricing Your Next WordPress Project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33285\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/18/chris-lema-and-steve-zehngut-pricing-your-next-wordpress-project/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:707:\"<div id=\"v-4keUiZV1-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33285/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33285/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33285&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/18/chris-lema-and-steve-zehngut-pricing-your-next-wordpress-project/\"><img alt=\"Chris Lema and Steve Zehngut: Pricing Your Next WordPress Project\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/4keUiZV1/video-15042e947b_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 22:47:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: How To Bulk Install All Your Favorite WordPress Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:174:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-bulk-install-all-your-favorite-wordpress-plugins?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-bulk-install-all-your-favorite-wordpress-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6830:\"<div id=\"attachment_19216\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bulk-install.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19100]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bulk-install.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: -pdp- - cc\" width=\"974\" height=\"524\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19216\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/51553705@N00/8191743/\">-pdp-</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Not every WordPress website is the same. But if you build with WordPress often enough, you might find that you prefer using the same set of plugins to provide basic functionality like contact forms, sharing buttons, SEO, caching, etc. It&#8217;s handy to have a set list of plugins that you can bulk-install whenever necessary.</p>\n<p>A question posed by Angie Meeker on Twitter inspired me to dig deeper into the best options available for doing this:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>Can we tag a bunch of plugins in the repo through our own profiles, then install those tagged plugins all at once? as a collection?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Angie Meeker (@angiemeeker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angiemeeker/statuses/445597703037124608\">March 17, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Favoriting Plugins on WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>If you have an account with WordPress.org, you can aggregate all of your most-used plugins by favoriting each of them. This will give you access to them in the WordPress admin. Input your WordPress.org username and your favorites will appear below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-plugin-favorites.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19100]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-plugin-favorites.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-plugin-favorites\" width=\"569\" height=\"253\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19179\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, there are a couple of drawbacks here. First, you won&#8217;t be able to include any plugins that are not hosted on WordPress.org. Second, it&#8217;s not yet possible to bulk install your favorite plugins. You&#8217;ll need to install them one by one. This method of getting your favorites works well if you only have a handful of plugins that you routinely install from WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Create an Installation Profile for WordPress</h3>\n<p>The best way to create a collection of WordPress plugins that can be bulk-installed is to customize your own installation profile. While these aren&#8217;t terribly common in WordPress, the Drupal community has several well-maintained <a href=\"https://drupal.org/developing/distributions\" target=\"_blank\">installation profiles and distributions</a> that are tailored to provide site features and functions for a specific type of site as a single download.</p>\n<h5>WP Install Profiles</h5>\n<p>There are a couple of solutions that make it easy for you to create your own custom installation profiles. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/install-profiles/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Install Profiles</a> is a plugin that enables you to define a group of plugins from WordPress.org and bulk install them to any site with a single click.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wp-install-profile.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19100]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wp-install-profile.jpg\" alt=\"wp-install-profile\" width=\"700\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19183\" /></a></p>\n<p>Those who use the WP Install Profile plugin can also share their installation profiles by uploading them to the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"http://plugins.ancillaryfactory.com/\" target=\"_blank\">homepage</a> where other users can copy them to use on their own sites. You are, however, limited to plugins hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h5>WP Roller</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://wproller.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Roller</a> is another option that Jeff Chandler <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/rolling-your-own-wordpress-with-wproller\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> last year. This service allows for more flexibility in the extensions you include in your installation profile. It allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include WordPress core</li>\n<li>Add plugins from WordPress.org and GitHub</li>\n<li>Upload your own plugins and themes</li>\n<li>Customize and save WordPress Installer Bundles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve made all your selections, the service lets you roll it up into one convenient download:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wp-roller.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19100]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wp-roller.jpg\" alt=\"wp-roller\" width=\"607\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19192\" /></a></p>\n<p>A nightly cron job runs to make sure that you&#8217;ll have the latest versions of themes and plugins ready to go in your installation zip file.</p>\n<p>One extra feature of WP Roller is that it allows you to quickly customize some common settings in your rollup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress site title</li>\n<li>WordPress site description</li>\n<li>Remove the &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; plugin</li>\n<li>Remove the &#8220;Hello Post&#8221;</li>\n<li>Remove the &#8220;About Page&#8221;</li>\n<li>Remove the &#8220;Sample Comment&#8221;</li>\n<li>Set your timezone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This saves you from having to click through to all of these places in the WordPress admin to put your settings in place.</p>\n<h5>DesktopServer</h5>\n<p><a href=\"http://serverpress.com/products/desktopserver/\" target=\"_blank\">DesktopServer</a> is a product from ServerPress that lets you easily create WordPress development environments. The commercial version of the product includes a &#8220;Blueprints&#8221; feature for automated WordPress configurations.</p>\n<p>The blueprints you customize contain pre-configured WordPress themes, plugins and set-ups that you might use regularly so that you can instantly create a site to your specifications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blueprints.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19100]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blueprints.jpg\" alt=\"blueprints\" width=\"608\" height=\"461\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19207\" /></a></p>\n<p>When setting up new sites with DesktopServer, you&#8217;ll have the option to select from among your blueprints in the dropdown, which will copy the contents of your blueprint to your development website. From there you can deploy it to a live site or continue working on it.</p>\n<p>The solution you select will depend entirely on where your plugins are hosted and whether or not you want to include themes and common settings.

According to iThemes, the plugin will be renamed to iThemes Security to be more in line with the other products in the iThemes family. Because of the name change, users will need to re-activate the plugin after upgrading or else you&#8217;ll see the following error.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19186\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iThemesSecurityRenameError.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19152]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-19186\" alt=\"Just Re-activate The Plugin To Fix This Error\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iThemesSecurityRenameError-500x145.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"145\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just Re-activate The Plugin To Fix This Error</p></div>\n<p>Besides the name change, a number of features will be added such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to add multiple reporting email addresses for backups and notifications</li>\n<li>Streamlined settings for easier configuration</li>\n<li>Full integration with <a href=\"http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy\">BackupBuddy</a></li>\n<li>A complete rewrite of existing features for faster, better, more secure sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BetterWPSecurityFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19152]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-19190\" alt=\"Better WP Security Featured Image\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BetterWPSecurityFeaturedImage-500x159.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"159\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hired in 2013, Chris Wiegman has been in charge of completely revamping the plugin. Between the name change, features, and rewriting of code, Better WP Security will be a completely new plugin. The revamp is not limited to just code as iThemes Security will have professional support options available through iThemes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Support for iThemes Security will now come exclusively through iThemes. We will be releasing those plans and packages with the new release next week.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Users will be happy to know the plugin will remain free of charge and available on the WordPress plugin repository. In the near future, iThemes plans on incorporating pro features to help monetize, fund development, and maintain the plugin. Cory Miller, CEO of iThemes said, &#8220;Current features will remain with no plans to discontinue them&#8221;. Last but not least, the free version will continue to be maintained as long as it&#8217;s useful to the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>This is a huge transition and considering Better WP Security is among the most popular plugins on the repository with over 1.7 million downloads, it will be hard to get users on the same page prior to upgrading, despite being warned a week in advance. Hopefully, none of them will think they&#8217;ve been hacked and instead upgrade without any problems.</p>\n<p>If you have questions or concerns about the changes, feel free to share them in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 19:27:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: Akismet Update Adds Security and Anti-Spam Improvements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19166\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:174:\"http://wptavern.com/akismet-update-adds-security-and-anti-spam-improvements?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=akismet-update-adds-security-and-anti-spam-improvements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3429:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/akismetlogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19166]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5792\" alt=\"akismet logo\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/akismetlogo.png\" width=\"187\" height=\"43\" /></a>Last week, we <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks\">wrote about</a> a report published by Sucuri that explained how 162,000 clean WordPress sites were used in a DDoS attack through the pingback functionality of XML-RPC. Alex Shiels who works on Akismet mentioned on Twitter the security team was working on a solution.</p>\n<p>An update to Akismet is <a title=\"http://blog.akismet.com/2014/03/18/akismet-plugin-2-6/\" href=\"http://blog.akismet.com/2014/03/18/akismet-plugin-2-6/\">now available</a> containing bug fixes, security, and anti-spam improvements. Notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include X-Pingback-Forwarded-For header in outbound WordPress pingback verifications.</li>\n<li>Add a pre-check for pingbacks, to stop spam before an outbound verification request is made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to Shiels, anti-spam checks were performed after a pingback was verified and WordPress didn&#8217;t pass on who made the request that caused it to verify a pingback effectively cloaking the true source. Shiels also stated the fixes applied to Akismet may find their way into the core of WordPress in a future update: &#8220;<em>We think a similar approach may be appropriate for core in a future release.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How To Disable Pingbacks On Content Already Published</h3>\n<p>While the security improvements in Akismet will have the widest impact, I still maintain that trackbacks and pingbacks have lost their luster. You can easily stop pingbacks in the <strong>Settings &#8211; Discussion</strong> area but to remove them from content already published involves using a MySQL query. Thankfully, there&#8217;s a plugin that bypasses the need to use the query called <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/autoclose/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/autoclose/\">Auto-Close Comments, Pingbacks and Trackbacks</a> by <a title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/ajay/\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/ajay/\">Ajay</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19170\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AutoCloseSettings.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19166]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-19170\" alt=\"Auto Close Pingbacks/Trackbacks Settings Page\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AutoCloseSettings-500x177.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"177\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Auto Close Pingbacks/Trackbacks Settings Page</p></div>\n<p>Auto-close gives users flexibility in determining which posts and pages ping/trackbacks will be disabled. There&#8217;s no option to disable them on every post or page. However, I was able to shut them off on most of my content by closing ping/trackbacks on posts older than one day. If you have a lot of content already published, you&#8217;ll want to use the built-in scheduler to avoid using too many resources on the server.</p>\n<p>The plugin works as advertised and is the only one I could find that has the ability to turn trackback and pingbacks off in bulk without using a database query.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 18:16:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.tv: John Lynn: Can You Make Money Blogging?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33166\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/18/john-lynn-can-you-make-money-blogging/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:654:\"<div id=\"v-gTtgGqKl-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33166/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33166/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33166&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/18/john-lynn-can-you-make-money-blogging/\"><img alt=\"John Lynn: Can You Make Money Blogging?\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/gTtgGqKl/video-329c8bc3ee_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 18:01:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Video Explains Open Source Using LEGO Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19154\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:140:\"http://wptavern.com/video-explains-open-source-using-legos?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=video-explains-open-source-using-legos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1887:\"<p>WordPress has benefited greatly from being Open Source software licensed under the GPL.

I&#8217;ve helped put the meeting together since 2009. Usually, we&#8217;ll have 10-25 people show up depending on the weather or if the event is on a holiday. Meetups are like a smaller version of WordCamps where individuals present on specific topics each month. Now that we have a healthy nucleus of regular attendees, the meetups almost run themselves.</p>\n<h3>Using Meetup.com To Start A Meetup</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19139\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UsingMeetup.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-19139\" alt=\"A Lot Of Meetups Happening In My Area\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UsingMeetup-500x164.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"164\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Lot Of Meetups Happening In My Area</p></div>\n<p>I recently saw someone ask how they can start a WordPress meetup. They lived in a city with a population of 75,000 people and according to Meetup.com, a WordPress group didn&#8217;t exist in their area. Launched in 2002, <a title=\"http://www.meetup.com/\" href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a> is the most popular website for getting people with like-minded ideas together. The site has meetups for any topic under the sun.</p>\n<p>Meetup organizers need to pay organizer dues before the meetup can be established on the site. Meetup.com has three pricing plans available and each plan allows you to run up to three separate meetups.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$12 a month for 6 months (a single $72 charge)</li>\n<li>$15 a month for 3 months (a single $45 charge)</li>\n<li>$19 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WordPress foundation has a <a title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/meetup-interest-form/\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/meetup-interest-form/\">program in place</a> that will pay membership dues so long as the group follows a few guidelines. In a nutshell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress meetups are for the benefit of the local community and are not to be used primarily for business purposes.</li>\n<li>The <a title=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\" href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">WordPress and WordCamp trademarks</a> should be respected.</li>\n<li>The meetup should foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re organizing a WordPress meetup solely for the purpose of meeting potential clients, you&#8217;re missing the point of what a community organized event is.</p>\n<h3>Try Not To Start A Meetup Alone</h3>\n<p>If possible, try to find one or two other people in your local area interested in having a WordPress meetup. In 2009, I asked on Twitter  if anyone in the North East Ohio area would be interested in attending a WordPress meetup. I discovered <a title=\"http://thecodecave.com/\" href=\"http://thecodecave.com/\">Brian Layman </a>who is a respected WordPress developer was just a short drive away from me as was <a title=\"http://kimparsell.com/\" href=\"http://kimparsell.com/\">Kim Parsell</a> and <a title=\"http://jefflee.co/\" href=\"http://jefflee.co/\">Jeff Lee</a>. I coordinated with them over Twitter and email to establish the core meetup group.</p>\n<p>Once we had a small dedicated group of individuals attending the meetup, we used our collective social media presence to announce and recruit interested members to the meetup. Keep in mind Meetup.com will notify registered users in the area when a new meetup is created that matches their interests. Also consider using the <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/about-the-meetups-forum\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/about-the-meetups-forum\">WordPress.org Meetup Forum</a> to tell others about the meetup.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19137\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NEOWPMeetup1.jpeg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19137\" alt=\"Brian Layman Sharing Knowledge\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NEOWPMeetup1.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brian Layman Sharing Knowledge</p></div>\n<p>I was lucky to have two to three people help me kick-start our meetup. If you can&#8217;t find attendees on Twitter or Facebook, try attending meetups in your area that are similar to WordPress. For instance, meetups on web design, content management, SEO, etc. will likely have a few WordPress people in attendance.</p>\n<h3>Finding A Venue</h3>\n<p>Finding a venue to host a meetup can be difficult. I recommend a place that has good WiFi, is somewhat quiet and set up for presentations. Co-working spaces are a great option to host a meetup since most of them contain the amenities I&#8217;ve outlined above. They have the side benefit of sometimes hosting workers that have an interest in WordPress. If you end up using a co-working space, ask around to see if anyone has an interest in WordPress. They could be your newest members to your meetup!</p>\n<h3>Immediately Establish Consistency</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest lessons learned while organizing a meetup is how important it is for the event to happen consistently at the same time. In the past, our meetup didn&#8217;t have a specific day of the month and was created when we felt like meeting up. This left people questioning whether or not there would be another meetup the following month.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19141\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MeetupConsistency.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19141\" alt=\"Schedule The Meetup To Happen At The Same Time Every Month\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MeetupConsistency.png\" width=\"523\" height=\"242\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make Your Meetup Predictable</p></div>\n<p>By immediately establish consistency, you&#8217;re giving attendees a chance to plan around your meetup. For example, ours is held on the fourth Thursday of every month. The only time it changes is during inclement weather or during a holiday. It&#8217;s important you communicate schedule changes as soon as possible to give attendees a chance to change their plans.</p>\n<h3>How Long Should The Meetup Be?</h3>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to have a time limit unless the venue requires you to leave at a certain time. Our meetup is typically two hours long with the first hour dedicated to a topic. Topics are decided either from the previous meeting or from users in our meetup.com group. If you&#8217;re thinking about doing a presentation at a WordCamp, meetups are an excellent opportunity to hone your skills. Presenting in front of 15-30 people is less stressful than a room of 50-100.</p>\n<h3>WordCamps Usually Start As Meetups First</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WordCampDayton2014Logo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12640\" alt=\"WordCamp Dayton 2014\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WordCampDayton2014Logo-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>When I asked Nathan Driver how <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dayton-a-flying-success\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dayton-a-flying-success\">WordCamp Dayton, Ohio</a> started, he told me it began with their local meetup. After visiting WordCamps throughout the state of Ohio, he discovered many of the attendees were from Southwest Ohio and wanted an event closer to home. He created a meetup around the Dayton area to gauge interest. “<em>After a couple of months of debating we went for it and had our first MeetUp in October 2012″.</em> After managing the meetup for a couple of months, Driver noticed interest grew along with memberships which is when he decided to begin the process of creating a WordCamp.</p>\n<h3>Starting A Meetup Is Not Hard But Requires Work and Dedication</h3>\n<p>Meetups require dedication and consistency to develop a community of their own. Don&#8217;t be discouraged if only three to five people show up. Use your meetup.com page as a hub and encourage attendees to leave feedback after every meeting. Make sure communication channels are open between the organizer and the attendees so everyone within the group is on the same page.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, have fun. Meetups don&#8217;t have to be serious and in my opinion, shouldn&#8217;t be. They are informal gatherings of people from all backgrounds united by an interest in WordPress.  If you have any suggestions for new WordPress meetup organizers, please add them in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 21:57:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Treehouse Expands WordPress Education to Include BuddyPress Beginners Course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:216:\"http://wptavern.com/treehouse-expands-wordpress-education-to-include-buddypress-beginners-course?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=treehouse-expands-wordpress-education-to-include-buddypress-beginners-course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3358:\"<p>Just one month after launching its <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/high-demand-for-wordpress-education-prompts-treehouse-to-launch-new-beginners-course\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress beginner&#8217;s course</a>, Treehouse has added BuddyPress education to its collection of interactive learning resources. The &#8220;<a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/library/learn-buddypress-social-networks-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Learn BuddyPress</a>&#8221; course is geared toward BuddyPress beginners and covers all the basics of setup, user management, and core social components.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buddypress-treehouse.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19096]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buddypress-treehouse.png\" alt=\"buddypress-treehouse\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19116\" /></a></p>\n<p>After reviewing the course, I was impressed by how quickly Gordon is able to communicate all the basics for gaining competence with BuddyPress, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting Started With BuddyPress:</strong> How to Install BP and configure its settings, register users and use the codex</li>\n<li><strong>BuddyPress Member Profiles:</strong> Setting up extended profile user fields, members page, status updates, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Interactions in BuddyPress:</strong> Friend connections, private messaging, mentioning users, notifications, activity, groups</li>\n<li><strong>Customizing BuddyPress:</strong> BP plugins, themes and customizations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each component is covered in great detail from both a user and community manager perspective. If you learn best by watching videos, then this course may be a good option for you, as it also includes an accompanying video transcript for each section. The lessons include links to the <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress codex</a> for further reference on the topics discussed.</p>\n<h3>Treehouse Plans to Add More BuddyPress Education Resources</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://zacgordon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zac Gordon</a>, Treehouse&#8217;s instructor for the course, said that they&#8217;ve been experiencing an increase in demand for BuddyPress education resources. He plans to create a BuddyPress Theme Development course to follow and may add a plugin development course sometime further down the road.</p>\n<p>With Treehouse&#8217;s expansion into resources for major WordPress plugins, I asked him if other extensions will be featured. &#8220;bbPress is definitely on my radar, although I&#8217;ve had no requests for it,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Jetpack would be a cool idea too, since we just did the WordPress.com course.&#8221; He&#8217;s currently experimenting with different course lengths and may produce a quick Jetpack resource within the next month or two.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/library/learn-buddypress-social-networks-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Learn BuddyPress</a> course is the first of its kind with in-depth video tutorials for every aspect of using BuddyPress. This is a great resource for teaching yourself the basics of BuddyPress over a weekend. The course is also a high quality option for BuddyPress developers to recommend to clients for basic support on how to use BuddyPress&#8217; core features.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 19:21:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress.tv: Chris Lema: WordCamp Las Vegas 2013 Opening Keynote\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33164\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/17/chris-lema-wordcamp-las-vegas-2013-opening-keynote/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:655:\"<div id=\"v-jsJVSQLw-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33164/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33164/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33164&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/17/chris-lema-wordcamp-las-vegas-2013-opening-keynote/\"><img alt=\"Chris Lema: Opening Keynote\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/jsJVSQLw/video-e208f2e698_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:59:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: 10up Hires CEO To Help Take Company To The Next Level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18705\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:170:\"http://wptavern.com/10up-hires-ceo-to-help-take-company-to-the-next-level?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10up-hires-ceo-to-help-take-company-to-the-next-level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2756:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10UpLogo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18705]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-13736\" alt=\"10up Logo\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10UpLogo.jpg\" width=\"139\" height=\"164\" /></a>WordPress development agency <a title=\"http://10up.com/\" href=\"http://10up.com/\">10up</a> has <a title=\"http://10up.com/blog/john-eckman-ceo/\" href=\"http://10up.com/blog/john-eckman-ceo/\">hired John Eckman</a> to take on the role of CEO. Eckman will work closely with Goldman and team leaders on the day-to-day operations of the company. Jake Goldman will remain as president and will focus on the products, strategic investments, and business development side of the company.</p>\n<p>Eckman has spent the last 15 years in the CMS ecosystem with five different companies both in the open-source and non open-source space. Before 10up, he worked for <a title=\"http://www.isitedesign.com/\" href=\"http://www.isitedesign.com/\">iSite Design</a>, a company that has a portfolio filled with companies from start-ups to non-profits to fortune 25 industry leaders.</p>\n<h3>Removing Obstacles To Enable More Efficient Employees</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obstaclesign.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18705]\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-19066\" alt=\"obstaclesign\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obstaclesign-249x300.png\" width=\"249\" height=\"300\" /></a>In the short-term, Eckman will observe how the company functions, locate growing pains and determine any obstacles he can remove to help employees become more efficient. Sometimes, a hiring like this can lead to immediate and drastic changes but Eckman wants the transition to be as smooth as possible. He doesn&#8217;t want to change the company culture if it&#8217;s working. Longer term, he wants to &#8220;<em>Make the team as efficient as possible. Remove non-productive frustrations and empower employees to be as productive as possible</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<h3>Executing The Vision</h3>\n<p>The hiring enables 10up to continue growing and to take on bigger projects. However, Eckman noted he wants to see the company continue to take on smaller more nimble projects. The goal is to have a wide-ranging portfolio showcasing the strengths of the company no matter how small or large the project. When I asked Eckman to summarize his position in the company, he said, &#8220;<em>Jake will drive the vision, I&#8217;ll execute it</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Also check out Brian Krogsgard&#8217;s <a title=\"http://www.poststat.us/evolution-10up/\" href=\"http://www.poststat.us/evolution-10up/\">hour long interview </a>where he sat down and talked to Jake Goldman and 10up&#8217;s new CEO John Eckman.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:22:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: How to Restrict a WordPress Author to Posting in One Category\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19061\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:186:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-restrict-a-wordpress-author-to-posting-in-one-category?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-restrict-a-wordpress-author-to-posting-in-one-category\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2726:\"<div id=\"attachment_19081\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/writing-featured.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19061]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/writing-featured.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: Nic\'s events - cc\" width=\"1021\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19081\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nics_events/2349632625/\">Nic&#8217;s events</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Multi-author WordPress blogs often have many authors working together to push out content, but not every author needs access to post to all categories on the site. In fact, there may be times when you want to limit an author to posting in just one assigned category for contributions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/restrict-author-posting/\" target=\"_blank\">Restrict Author Posting</a> is a new plugin that allows administrators to restrict authors, on an individual basis, to post in only one category. This is a lightweight, specific-use plugin that doesn&#8217;t alter any other capabilities or permissions.</p>\n<p>Once you install it, administrators can navigate to each user that they want to restrict and assign a category.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19061]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-1.png\" alt=\"restrict-author-posting-1\" width=\"709\" height=\"283\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19088\" /></a></p>\n<p>When the author goes to create a new post, the meta box listing all of the categories will not be available. Instead, the author will see a notice of which category the post will fall under.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19061]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-2.png\" alt=\"restrict-author-posting-2\" width=\"580\" height=\"262\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19089\" /></a></p>\n<p>Restrict Author Posting is a plugin that you might never think of until you have a situation where you need it. Put it in place to streamline contributions on a multi-author site by herding authors into their assigned categories. This saves you the trouble of having to double check posts to make sure they fall under the correct category. It also helps to ensure that authors don&#8217;t go crazy creating new categories for every post.

2009[/sectiontitle]\n\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\n\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\n\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\n\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\n<div>\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family.

There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\n\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-autosave-v1','','','2014-03-18 20:46:54','2014-03-18 20:46:54','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-autosave-v1',0,'revision','',0),(436,1,'2014-03-16 21:13:08','2014-03-16 21:13:08','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-16 21:13:08','2014-03-16 21:13:08','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(8,1,'2014-01-16 05:43:34','2014-01-16 05:43:34','','Stories','','inherit','open','open','','7-revision-v1','','','2014-01-16 05:43:34','2014-01-16 05:43:34','',7,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/7-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(9,1,'2014-01-16 05:44:36','2014-01-16 05:44:36','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl Abby Shah and her father Jayesh Shah.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>          <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" alt=\"DSCF7662 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a>           <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-479\" alt=\"DSCF7235 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','publish','open','closed','','diary-of-a-visit','','','2014-03-19 03:35:48','2014-03-19 03:35:48','',0,'http://handmaids-local/?page_id=9',5,'page','',0),(433,1,'2014-03-16 21:01:12','2014-03-16 21:01:12','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture.

They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAma then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\nAfter volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-16 21:01:12','2014-03-16 21:01:12','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(432,1,'2014-03-16 20:58:07','2014-03-16 20:58:07','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAma then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-94\" alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-b142-efc1-cebbe252de44\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\nAfter volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-16 20:58:07','2014-03-16 20:58:07','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(431,1,'2014-03-16 20:52:56','2014-03-16 20:52:56','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m. Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-6283-c35c-bd6907b38d00\">In Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets.

In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-94\" alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-b142-efc1-cebbe252de44\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\nAfter volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project.

We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3730-d48f-f750-b23c8486e647\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m. Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-6283-c35c-bd6907b38d00\">In Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE.

In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood.

These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-94\" alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-b142-efc1-cebbe252de44\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\nAfter volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-16 20:13:08','2014-03-16 20:13:08','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(173,1,'2014-03-19 03:22:10','2014-03-19 03:22:10','<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The HMBT order has relied entirely on receiving outside donations and generating of funds from within.  There is no steady stream of funding coming from any parent organization.   The HMBT is registered as an Indian NGO under the secular name Sneha Jewan Kendra which means Love and Life Center.  Effort is currently underway to register Sneha Jewan Kendra in the United States as a charitable 501 C 3 organization.  </span>\n\nOn the left sidebar of this page you can see a list of the major current needs at the orphanages.   You will also see examples of recently funded and implemented projects.\n\nYour contribution is greatly appreciated by the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity and betters the lives of the orphans under their care.\n\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\" target=\"_blank\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"BGG3VL42SCA5L\" />\n<input type=\"image\" alt=\"PayPal -

She was sent to a Mumbai hospital where she spent several months.  When she emerged from recuperation Mother Teresa urged her to remain in Mumbai in a life of service.  This is how, in 1989,  she became the foundress of a new order of nuns called the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity.  Today the order contains about 40 nuns;  about 10 of these are directly working with Sr. Paulette at the orphanages.</p>\r\n&nbsp;','Sr. Paulette','','publish','open','open','','paulette','','','2014-03-15 19:01:32','2014-03-15 19:01:32','',7,'http://handmaids-local/?page_id=25',0,'page','',0),(26,1,'2014-01-18 03:38:36','2014-01-18 03:38:36','This is a story about Paulette.','Paulette','','inherit','open','open','','25-revision-v1','','','2014-01-18 03:38:36','2014-01-18 03:38:36','',25,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/25-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(70,1,'2014-02-15 19:52:37','2014-02-15 19:52:37','','classmates','','inherit','open','open','','classmates','','','2014-02-15 19:52:37','2014-02-15 19:52:37','',0,'http://handmaids-local/wp-content/uploads/classmates.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(71,1,'2014-02-15 19:52:54','2014-02-15 19:52:54','','ready_to_learn','','inherit','open','open','','ready_to_learn','','','2014-02-15 19:52:54','2014-02-15 19:52:54','',0,'http://handmaids-local/wp-content/uploads/ready_to_learn.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(44,1,'2014-02-07 02:48:16','2014-02-07 02:48:16','','Media','','publish','open','open','','media','','','2014-03-23 19:57:20','2014-03-23 19:57:20','',0,'http://handmaids-local/?post_type=_pods_pod&#038;p=44',0,'_pods_pod','',0),(45,1,'2014-02-07 02:52:04','2014-02-07 02:52:04','Type in the name of the carousel you want this image to appear in.

Today this school goes through 7th standard and has 300 kids, all packed tightly in the orphanage house which is about 2000 square feet.  The children attending this school have no other viable option.  They are unable to go to the already impacted government schools and nearby private schools are unaffordable.  The HMBT school offers a low cost English medium education in subjects ranging from science, to math, to crafts, to language.  Were it not for this school, many of the kids would receive no education.  At Merces - Giriz the orphans all attend local independent schools, the cost of which is borne by the HMBT','History','','inherit','open','open','','141-revision-v1','','','2014-02-26 04:18:56','2014-02-26 04:18:56','',141,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/141-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(151,1,'2014-02-26 04:36:37','2014-02-26 04:36:37','The left side bar of this page will take you to some typical orphan profiles.\r\n\r\nThere are about 30 orphans at Sahar and about 100 at Merces-Giriz.  They range from 3 years to 16 years old.  Their parents have died either due to disease, violent crime,  self neglect,  or are in prison.\r\n\r\nSome of the kids are not \"orphans\" but have been brought by a parent or family member because they are physically or financially unable to care for them.  Often, there will be one surviving parent or a distant relative that continues to visit their child at the orphanages and this individual will eventually accept the child back.   But while they are there, the HMBT Sisters care for them completely.\r\n\r\nOn a typical day they will arise at 5:30-6:00 am.  After eating breakfast they will get dressed and ready for school which  goes till the early afternoon.   At Sahar the school is within the orphanage house itself;  at Merces-Giriz the kids take a bus or walk to nearby independent schools.   In the mid-afternoon there is additonal tutoring by a paid teacher at Sahar and by volunteer local college students at Merces-Giriz.  In the late afternoon the kids all do homework,  chores, have play time,  take baths, eat dinner and have prayer time.  They typically go to bed around 9 pm.    On Sundays, there is extra time for watching T.V.,  having a party, music, dance,  and also visits by family members or persons from the community.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Orphan Profiles','','publish','open','closed','','orphans','','','2014-03-13 13:16:22','2014-03-13 13:16:22','',0,'http://handmaids-local/?page_id=151',4,'page','',0),(152,1,'2014-02-26 04:36:37','2014-02-26 04:36:37','','Orphans','','inherit','open','open','','151-revision-v1','','','2014-02-26 04:36:37','2014-02-26 04:36:37','',151,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/151-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(171,1,'2014-02-26 05:02:12','2014-02-26 05:02:12','On this page you will see a brief biographical sketch of key people of the HMBT','Sister Bios','','inherit','open','open','','7-revision-v1','','','2014-02-26 05:02:12','2014-02-26 05:02:12','',7,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/7-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(153,1,'2014-02-26 04:38:54','2014-02-26 04:38:54','<strong>This is the Stories page!</strong>\r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Paulette and Eliza.  Together they  worked and lived in the slum areas around the International Airport in Mumbai known as the Sahar Slums (the specific location of the current Sahar Orphanage is called Church Pakadi).</p>\r\n Living and working in the slums they were aware of the serious problems faced by families, especially women and children: lack of food, severe malnutrition, lack of schooling or even a place to study, lack of electricity in their hut like living quarters, and even lack of a bathroom. The went door to door and did a lot of counseling, direct care, weighing of babies, tracking growth, giving food, taking of individuals to medical care, and gave other assistance.   Through their outreach the Srs. became known in the area and to social service agencies.  Often orphaned children and babies would be left at their doorstep at Sahar and the Sisters would work diligently to care for them and place them into nearby orphanages.  Eventually it became very evident to them that they would have to run their own orphanage.\r\n\r\nIn the Sahar slum they got an opportunity to take care of a widowed lady in exchange for living at her meager home (a slum hut).  Upon her death she donated the property to the local church.  The sisters were able to purchase this property from the church to develop a home base.  Also  around that time they received a donation of land at Merces (a suburb of Mumbai) on which they built a convent house.  Both the Sahar and Merces sites began as convent houses but grew to become orphanages, and the Sahar site grew to also become a school.   The HMBT order has relied entirely on donations and generating of funds from within.  There is no steady stream of funding coming from a parent organization.  In the early years the Srs. were helped greatly by donations from J.P. Morgan.  They were able to use this assistance to do the needed building construction.  Previously they were literally residing in huts or make shift domiciles without a roof.\r\n\r\nOver the years the sisters have overcome many challenges running their organization and being responsible for all the orphans under their care. Then, and even now, the sisters often arise at 5 in the morning and don’t retire till late at night attending to their mission diligently.  They have grown as an order from just 2 to now about 40 nuns (about 10 of these involved with the orphanages).\r\n\r\nThe orphanages  have evolved gradually, for practical reasons,  into their current set up in which they are  girls only orphanages.  The boys  previously residing there have all been placed with other orphanages or extended family.  There is  some ongoing turnover of the resident children.  Some of the kids leave if extended family eventually claims them.  Some of the kids leave because they don’t tolerate the structure that is maintained at the orphanage.  Most, however, stay several years, all the way up to becoming young adults that get jobs and even marry and start their own families.\r\n\r\nIt has always been important to the Sisters to educate the children in their care.  They worked against many obstacles to develop a school at the Sahar Orphanage.   Over the years the school became more widely attended by even the non-orphan children from the adjacent and nearby slums.  Today this school goes through 7th standard and has 300 kids, all packed tightly in the orphanage house which is about 2000 square feet.  A typical classroom is about 200 square feet and holds about 30 kids.  The teachers, who come from nearby communities,  are paid 400 Rupees per month.  The children attending this school have no other viable option.  They are unable to go to the already impacted government schools and nearby private schools are unaffordable.  The HMBT school offers a low cost English medium education in subjects ranging from science, to math, to crafts, to language.  Were it not for this school, many of the kids would receive no education.  At Merces - Giriz the orphans all attend local independent schools, the cost of which is borne by the

an order of nuns known as the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity.   The main mission of the HMBT order was to reach out to impoverished women and children for their health and well being.  In the early years starting around 1989 up until recently,  it was only Srs. Paulette and Eliza.  Together they  worked and lived in the slum areas around the International Airport in Mumbai known as the Sahar Slums (the specific location of the current Sahar Orphanage is in the Church Pakadi slum).</p>\r\n Living and working in the slums they were aware of the serious problems faced by families, especially women and children: lack of food, severe malnutrition, lack of schooling or even a place to study, lack of electricity in their hut like living quarters, and even lack of a bathroom. The went door to door and did a lot of counseling, direct care, weighing of babies, tracking growth, giving food, taking of individuals to medical care, and gave other assistance.   Through their outreach the Srs. became known in the area and to social service agencies.  Often orphaned children and babies would be left at their doorstep at Sahar and the Sisters would work diligently to care for them and place them into nearby orphanages.  Eventually it became very evident to them that they would have to run their own orphanage.\r\n\r\nIn the Sahar slum they got an opportunity to take care of a widowed lady in exchange for living at her meager home (a slum hut).  Upon her death she donated the property to the local church.  The sisters were able to purchase this property from the church to develop a home base.  Also  around that time they received a donation of land at Merces (a suburb of Mumbai) on which they built a convent house.  Both the Sahar and Merces sites began as convent houses for the HMBT order but grew to become orphanages around 1996, and the Sahar site grew to also become a school.   The HMBT order has relied entirely on donations and generating of funds from within.  There is no steady stream of funding coming from a parent organization.  In the early years the Srs. were helped greatly by donations from J.P. Morgan.  They were able to use this assistance to do the needed building construction.  Previously they were literally residing in huts or make shift domiciles without a roof.\r\n\r\nOver the years the sisters have overcome many challenges running their organization and being responsible for all the orphans under their care. Then, and even now, the sisters often arise at 5 in the morning and don’t retire till late at night attending to their mission diligently.  They have grown as an order from just 2 nuns to recently about 40 nuns.  About 10 of these are involved with the orphanages and the remainder are doing parish work in other states in India.\r\n\r\nThe orphanages  have evolved gradually into becoming girls only orphanages today.  The boys  previously living there have all been placed with other orphanages or extended family.  For practical reasons it was not possible to have co-ed orphanages.  The boys were often disruptive around girls, not having any residential mentors or father figures.  Also it was not possible to maintain separate living quarters for boys and girls.    There is  some ongoing turnover of the resident children.  Some of the kids leave if extended family eventually claims them.  Some of the kids leave because they don’t tolerate the structure that is maintained at the orphanage.  Most, however, stay several years, all the way up to becoming young adults that get jobs and even marry and start their own families.\r\n\r\nIt has always been important to the Sisters to educate the children in their care.  They worked against many obstacles to develop a school at the Sahar Orphanage.   Over the years the school became more widely attended by even the non-orphan children from the adjacent and nearby slums.  Today this school goes through 7th standard and has 300 kids, all packed tightly in the orphanage house which is about 2000 square feet.  A typical classroom is about 200 square feet and holds about 30 kids.  The teachers, who come from nearby communities,  are paid 400 Rupees per month.  The children attending this school have no other viable option.  They are unable to go to the already impacted government schools and nearby private schools are unaffordable.  The HMBT school offers a low cost English medium education in subjects ranging from science, to math, to crafts, to language.  Were it not for this school, many of the kids would receive no education.  At Merces -

children for their health and well being.  In the early years starting around 1989, and up to recently,  it was only Srs. Paulette and Eliza.  Together they  worked and lived in the slum areas around the International Airport in Mumbai known as the Sahar Slums (the specific location of the current Sahar Orphanage is in the Church Pakadi slum).</p>\r\n Living and working in the slums they were aware of the serious problems faced by families, especially women and children: lack of food, severe malnutrition, lack of schooling or even a place to study, lack of electricity in their hut like living quarters, and even lack of a bathroom. The went door to door and did a lot of counseling, direct care, weighing of babies, tracking growth, giving food, taking of individuals to medical care, and gave other assistance.   Through their outreach the Srs. became known in the area and to local social service agencies.  Often,  orphaned children and babies would be left at their doorstep at Sahar and the Sisters would work diligently to care for them and place them into nearby orphanages.  Eventually it became very evident to them that they would have to run their own orphanage.\r\n\r\nIn the Sahar slum they got an opportunity to take care of a widowed lady in exchange for living at her meager home (a slum hut).  Upon her death she donated the property to the local church.  The sisters were able to purchase this property from the church to develop a home base.  Also  around that time they received a donation of land at Merces (a suburb of Mumbai) on which they built a convent house.  Both the Sahar and Merces sites began as convent houses for the HMBT order but grew to become orphanages around 1996, and the Sahar site grew to also become a school.   The HMBT order has relied entirely on donations and generating of funds from within.  There is no steady stream of funding coming from a parent organization.  In the early years the Srs. were helped greatly by donations from J.P. Morgan.  They were able to use this assistance to do the needed building construction.  Previously they were literally residing in huts or make shift domiciles without a roof.\r\n\r\nOver the years the sisters have overcome many challenges running their organization and being responsible for all the orphans under their care. Then, and even now, the sisters often arise at 5 in the morning and don’t retire till late at night attending to their mission diligently.  They have grown as an order from just 2 nuns to recently about 40 nuns.  About 10 of these are involved with the orphanages and the remainder are doing parish work in other states in India.\r\n\r\nThe orphanages  have evolved gradually into becoming girls only orphanages today.  The boys  previously living there have all been placed with other orphanages or extended family.  For practical reasons it was not possible to have co-ed orphanages.  The boys were often disruptive around girls, not having any male residential mentors or father figures.  Also,  it was not possible to maintain separate living quarters for boys and girls.    There is  some ongoing turnover of the resident children.  Some of the kids leave if extended family eventually claims them.  Some of the kids leave because they don’t tolerate the structure that is maintained at the orphanage.  Most, however, stay several years, all the way up to becoming young adults that get jobs and even marry and start their own families.\r\n\r\nIt has always been important to the Sisters to educate the children in their care.  They worked against many obstacles to develop a school at the Sahar Orphanage.   Over the years the school became more widely attended by even  non-orphan children from the adjacent and nearby slums.  Today this school goes through 7th standard and has 300 kids, all packed tightly in the orphanage house which is about 2000 square feet.  A typical classroom is about 200 square feet and holds about 30 kids.  The teachers, who come from nearby communities,  are paid 400 Rupees per month.  The children attending this school have no other viable school option.  They are unable to go to the already impacted government schools and nearby private schools are unaffordable for their families.  The HMBT school offers them a low cost education in subjects ranging from english, to science, to math, to crafts.  Were it not for this school, many of the kids would receive no education.  At Merces - Giriz the orphans all attend local independent schools, the cost of which is borne by the HMBT','History','','inherit','open','open','','141-revision-v1','','','2014-03-12 02:30:45','2014-03-12 02:30:45','',141,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/141-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(323,1,'2014-03-12 02:54:37','2014-03-12 02:54:37','<p dir=\"ltr\">[subpages depth=\"0\"]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Handmaids Orphanages were started by an order of nuns known as the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity.   The main mission of the HMBT order was to reach out to impoverished women and children for their health and well being.  In the early years starting around 1989, and up to recently,  it was only Srs.

classroom is about 200 square feet and holds about 30 kids.  The teachers, who come from nearby communities,  are paid 400 Rupees per month.  The children attending this school have no other viable school option.  They are unable to go to the already impacted government schools and nearby private schools are unaffordable for their families.  The HMBT school offers them a low cost education in subjects ranging from english, to science, to math, to crafts.  Were it not for this school, many of the kids would receive no education.  At Merces - Giriz the orphans all attend local independent schools, the cost of which is borne by the HMBT','History','','inherit','open','open','','141-revision-v1','','','2014-03-12 03:19:13','2014-03-12

She was sent to a Mumbai hospital where she spent several months.  When she emerged from recuperation Mother Teresa urged her to remain in Mumbai in a life of service.  This is how, in 1989,  she became the foundress of a new order of nuns called the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity.  Today the order contains about 40 nuns;  about 10 of these are directly working with Sr. Paulette at the orphanages.</p>\r\n&nbsp;','Paulette','','inherit','open','open','','25-revision-v1','','','2014-03-12 13:32:18','2014-03-12 13:32:18','',25,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/25-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(359,1,'2014-03-12 13:35:11','2014-03-12 13:35:11','<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01143-Small.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-295\" alt=\"DSC01143 (Small)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01143-Small.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amma is the resident caretaker of the orphans at Sahar.  She is in her 70’s, a widow.  She was shunned by her own family.  This is how she came to  join the family of the HMBT nuns and orphans for whom she has worked tirelessly for the past 15 years.  She is responsible for cooking, feeding, bathing and dressing the kids,  and being a grandmother to all of them.</p>','Amma','','inherit','open','open','','137-revision-v1','','','2014-03-12 13:35:11','2014-03-12 13:35:11','',137,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/137-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(360,1,'2014-03-12 13:43:31','2014-03-12 13:43:31','&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Tulsi Shetty<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01134-Small.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-292\" alt=\"DSC01134 (Small)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01134-Small.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Gauri Shetty<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-293\" alt=\"DSC01136 (Small)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01136-Small.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" />Tulsi was born November 2003 and her sister Gauri was born April 2005.  Both are living at the Sahar Orphanage.  They are in 3rd and 2nd standard respectively.  Their mother died in a road accident.  Their father had no job and was homeless so he brought the girls to the orphanage.   He hopes to collect them after they complete school through the 7th standard at Sahar,  by which time he hopes his personal situation will have improved.</p>','Tulsi & Gauri Shetty','','inherit','open','open','','162-revision-v1','','','2014-03-12 13:43:31','2014-03-12 13:43:31','',162,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/162-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(362,1,'2014-03-12 13:48:40','2014-03-12 13:48:40','<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The Handmaids Orphanages were started by an order of nuns known as the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity.   The main mission of the HMBT order was to reach out to impoverished women and children for their health and well being.  In the early years starting around 1989, and up to recently,  it was only Srs.

Merces-Giriz.  They range from 3 years to 16 years old.  Their parents have died either due to disease, violent crime,  self neglect,  or are in prison.\r\n\r\nSome of the kids are not \"orphans\" but have been brought by a parent or family member because they are physically or financially unable to care for them.  Often, there will be one surviving parent or a distant relative that continues to visit their child at the orphanages and this individual will eventually accept the child back.   But while they are there, the HMBT Sisters care for them completely.\r\n\r\nOn a typical day they will arise at 5:30-6:00 am.  After eating breakfast they will get dressed and ready for school which  goes till the early afternoon.   At Sahar the school is within the orphanage house itself;  at Merces-Giriz the kids take a bus or walk to nearby independent schools.   In the mid-afternoon there is additonal tutoring by a paid teacher at Sahar and by volunteer local college students at Merces-Giriz.  In the late afternoon the kids all do homework,  chores, have play time,  take baths, eat dinner and have prayer time.  They typically go to bed around 9 pm.    On Sundays, there is extra time for watching T.V.,  having a party, music, dance,  and also visits by family members or persons from the community.\r\n\r\nOn this page you will find some profiles typical of the orphans.','Orphan Profiles','','inherit','open','open','','151-revision-v1','','','2014-03-13 02:28:43','2014-03-13

We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings.

We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary11.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary11\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary11-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m. Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-6283-c35c-bd6907b38d00\">In Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-94\" alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-b142-efc1-cebbe252de44\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.\r\n\r\nAfter volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary11.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary11\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary11-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m. Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-6283-c35c-bd6907b38d00\">In Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-94\" alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-b142-efc1-cebbe252de44\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\nAfter volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors.

Giriz the orphans all attend local independent schools, the cost of which is borne by the HMBT','History','','inherit','open','open','','141-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:11:07','2014-03-15 19:11:07','',141,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/141-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(424,1,'2014-03-15 19:14:56','2014-03-15 19:14:56','','Bios','','inherit','open','open','','7-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:14:56','2014-03-15 19:14:56','',7,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/7-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(423,1,'2014-03-15 19:14:39','2014-03-15 19:14:39','djflajsdfk','Bios','','inherit','open','open','','7-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:14:39','2014-03-15 19:14:39','',7,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/7-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(425,1,'2014-03-15 19:19:25','2014-03-15 19:19:25','<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01140-Small.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-294\" alt=\"DSC01140 (Small)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01140-Small.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"288\" /></a>Sneha was born September 2003.   She is currently healthy.  She has been living at the Sahar Orphanage since the age of 3 when she was brought there by her grandmother who still visits.</p>\r\nHer father had burned her mother to death over a property dispute and spent some time in jail.  His brother bought for him his way out of jail within the corrupt system in India.  He is forbidden from seeing Sneha.  Her brother Sopnil is 2 years older.  He was living at the Merces Orphange but is currently at another orphanage.\r\n\r\nShe attends 3rd standard at the Sahar Orphanage School and is maintaining an average academic performance in her class of 50 students.','Sneha Borde','','inherit','open','open','','164-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:19:25','2014-03-15 19:19:25','',164,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/164-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(426,1,'2014-03-15 19:20:46','2014-03-15 19:20:46','<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01140-Small.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-294\" alt=\"DSC01140 (Small)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSC01140-Small.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"288\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sneha was born September 2003.   She is currently healthy.  She has been living at the Sahar Orphanage since the age of 3 when she was brought there by her grandmother who still visits.</p>\r\nHer father had burned her mother to death over a property dispute and spent some time in jail.  His brother bought for him his way out of jail within the corrupt system in India.  He is forbidden from seeing Sneha.  Her brother Sopnil is 2 years older.  He was living at the Merces Orphange but is currently at another orphanage.\r\n\r\nShe attends 3rd standard at the Sahar Orphanage School and is maintaining an average academic performance in her class of 50 students.','Sneha Borde','','inherit','open','open','','164-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:20:46','2014-03-15 19:20:46','',164,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/164-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(428,1,'2014-03-15 19:27:06','2014-03-15 19:27:06','Our Locations:  XXXX  Pictorial MAP GRAPHIC XXXX\r\n\r\nOur Postal Adresses:  XXX  Adresses of Church Pakadi,  Merces, Giriz  (within a box outline)  XXX\r\n\r\n[googlemap height=\"300\" zoom=\"13\" lat=\"19.0822507\" long=\"72.8812041\"]\r\n\r\nSend us an e-mail:\r\n\r\n[bestwebsoft_contact_form]','Contact Us','','inherit','open','open','','123-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:27:06','2014-03-15 19:27:06','',123,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/123-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(427,1,'2014-03-15 19:26:27','2014-03-15 19:26:27','Our Locations:  XXXX  Pictorial MAP GRAPHIC XXXX\r\n\r\nOur Postal Adresses:  XXX  Adresses of Church Pakadi,  Merces, Giriz  (within a box outline)  XXX\r\n\r\n[googlemap height=\"300\" zoom=\"13\" lat=\"19.0822507\" long=\"72.8812041\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[googlemap height=\"300\" zoom=\"13\" lat=\"30.0822507\" long=\"72.8812041\"]\r\n\r\nSend us an e-mail:\r\n\r\n[bestwebsoft_contact_form]','Contact Us','','inherit','open','open','','123-revision-v1','','','2014-03-15 19:26:27','2014-03-15 19:26:27','',123,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/123-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(434,1,'2014-03-16 21:07:55','2014-03-16 21:07:55','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning. After breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAma then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well.

They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed.

We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well.

They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed.

We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed. She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors.

We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project.

This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary1\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She got polio when she was really young and she survived. Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project.

Paulette and Eliza.  Together they  worked and lived in the slum areas around the International Airport in Mumbai known as the Sahar Slums (the specific location of the current Sahar Orphanage is in the Church Pakadi slum).</span></p>\r\nLiving and working in the slums they were aware of the serious problems faced by families, especially women and children: lack of food, severe malnutrition, lack of schooling or even a place to study, lack of electricity in their hut like living quarters, and even lack of a bathroom.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.  She got polio when she was really young and she survived.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:37:16','2014-03-19 01:37:16','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(469,1,'2014-03-19 01:40:16','2014-03-19 01:40:16','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India.

Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.  She got polio when she was really young and she survived.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:40:16','2014-03-19 01:40:16','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(470,1,'2014-03-19 01:40:49','2014-03-19 01:40:49','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary6\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary6-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:40:49','2014-03-19 01:40:49','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(471,1,'2014-03-19 01:45:34','2014-03-19 01:45:34','','DSCF7227 (Mobile)','','inherit','open','open','','dscf7227-mobile','','','2014-03-19 01:45:34','2014-03-19 01:45:34','',9,'http://handmaids-local/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7227-Mobile.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(472,1,'2014-03-19 01:46:45','2014-03-19 01:46:45','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:46:45','2014-03-19 01:46:45','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(473,1,'2014-03-19 01:50:07','2014-03-19 01:50:07','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>   <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary22\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary22-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>           <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:50:50','2014-03-19 01:50:50','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(475,1,'2014-03-19 01:52:23','2014-03-19 01:52:23','','DSCF7662 (Mobile)','','inherit','open','open','','dscf7662-mobile','','','2014-03-19 01:52:23','2014-03-19 01:52:23','',9,'http://handmaids-local/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(476,1,'2014-03-19 01:53:46','2014-03-19 01:53:46','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" alt=\"DSCF7662 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a>    <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:53:46','2014-03-19 01:53:46','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(477,1,'2014-03-19 01:54:15','2014-03-19 01:54:15','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai.

They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" alt=\"DSCF7662 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a>           <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:54:15','2014-03-19 01:54:15','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(478,1,'2014-03-19 01:58:05','2014-03-19 01:58:05','This is a blog of a visit to the HMBT orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl and her father.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.  She got polio when she was really young and she survived.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>          <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw.

An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" alt=\"DSCF7662 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a>           <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-72\" alt=\"diary25\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary25-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 01:58:05','2014-03-19 01:58:05','',9,'http://handmaids-local/uncategorized/9-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(479,1,'2014-03-19 02:01:11','2014-03-19 02:01:11','','DSCF7235 (Mobile)','','inherit','open','open','','dscf7235-mobile','','','2014-03-19 02:01:11','2014-03-19 02:01:11','',9,'http://handmaids-local/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0);

We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage.

The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.  She got polio when she was really young and she survived.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy.

In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture.

Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>          <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order. They are her whole life and she loves them like they are her own children.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary14\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary14-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule for the Sahar Orphanage children starts in the morning with Ama bathing them and then feeding them. For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" alt=\"DSCF7662 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a>           <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-479\" alt=\"DSCF7235 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project. If you are reading this please consider making a donation.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>','Diary of a Visit','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2014-03-19 02:02:13','2014-03-19

orphanages in December, 2009 written by a 13 year old girl Abby Shah and her father Jayesh Shah.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Sunday, November 22, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\n<strong>Planning our trip to India</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re planning our trip to India. We are planning to volunteer at the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity orphanage, in the Sahar Slum of Mumbai, where we will be trying to teach the kids there English. We are learning a little bit of Hindi before we go so it will be easier to get to know the people at the orphanage. There will be thirty kids there ages running from 4 to 12.\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 9, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n\r\nWe are already starting to get some donations for the Orphanages. This is really exciting we are looking forward to actually meeting the orphans.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>[sectiontitle]Sunday, December 13, 2009[/sectiontitle]</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7035-Small.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-442\" alt=\"DSCF7035 (Small)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7035-Small.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>On our first day at the Sahar Orphanage we were welcomed very warmly. The kids knew that we were coming and happy to finally see us. We’ve gone to two of the orphanages so far. At the first one we helped the kids a little with their English writing letters and numbers. At the big orphanage my dad (who is a doctor) checked over the kids and helped diagnose their conditions. I think the kids have a lot of responsibility and they are all mothering each other because they are all like a big family. The sisters devoted their whole lives to help these children and they are doing a really good j0b. It seems like the community the big orphanage is in is really nice, they contribute food on holidays and Sundays. The slums in real life are exactly what they look like in “Slumdog Millionaire”. It’s sad looking at the kids running through the traffic begging for food and money…</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n[sectiontitle]Monday, December 14, 2009[/sectiontitle]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary2\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary2-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-372c-849e-1281-fb95cd743eac\">The Sisters running the Sahar Slum Orphanage also run another orphanage at Vasai. There are 200 kids here, boys and girls, aged from 5 to 14. This orphanage is in a country setting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday when we were at the Vasai orphanage we saw a girl with polio. Her aged face was the only reason we could tell she was older than 11. She was all curled up and her back was very deformed.  She got polio when she was really young and she survived.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"DSCF7160 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7160-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Her parents couldn’t deal with a crippled child so they abandoned her to the orphanage. The nuns don’t have enough money to buy her a wheelchair or time to do physical therapy. We are using some of the money we collected from donations to get a wheelchair for her so she doesn’t have to ever drag herself around with only her arms again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary3\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary3-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2eb0e328-372f-7b9f-d3da-cb51a7367ade\">Though the traffic is CRAZY here, i think it is safe because everybody is watching out for themselves and looking more at their surroundings. In America there are so many rules that if somebody breaks one, people aren’t prepared and there is panic and confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People in India seem very casual and easy going. We were walking through the slums to get to the orphanage and we came across a few boys playing outside with a top. They said “hi” and I stopped to watch them and take their picture. They didn’t speak English but they all lined up for me to take a photo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary4\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary4-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was surprising that people living in such poverty could be so free and friendly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even the dogs seem laid back; they never bark or chase you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" alt=\"DSCF7095 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7095-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slums are very smelly and dirty. There are open sewers and piles of garbage throughout the slum village. The filth is scattered around houses and the marketplace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary5\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary5-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet there is still beauty in the slums…</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7227-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-471\" alt=\"DSCF7227 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7227-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"427\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been visiting the Sahar slum orphanage that is run by sisters Eliza and Paulette of the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Today we went to the orphanage just expecting the thirty orphans but we found out that the orphanage is also the site of a low cost school for the slums. There were 500 kids aged 3-14 packed into classrooms with a collective space similar to a three bedroom apartment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary7\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary7-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3731-87c0-c81e-8d26bdc27188\">Some kids start school late so there are a few older kids in lower standards (grades). For example there is a girl in this slum school who was born and raised in a small village and her family just moved to the slum area to get jobs in the city. They then started sending her to the school so now she is in the second standard even though she’s already 13 years old.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary8\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary8-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>          <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary9\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary9-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Wednesday, December 16, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were waiting outside the Sahar Orphanage and I was sketching out possible pictures for the kids to learn how to draw. A group of 4th standard slum kids just getting out of school walked by in their uniforms. They stopped to look at my pictures and my dad sat them all down around me and handed out sheets of paper. A boy and a small girl got their pencils out and I taught them how to draw a dinosaur. It was a happy experience changing this group of slum kid’s day from just average to great. They really like getting one on one attention and it feels really good to help these kids.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary10\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary10-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the same day we did a friendship bracelet project with the orphans. Some of the kids caught on really fast and didn’t need any help; they helped some of the younger kids who didn’t understand how to make the bracelets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary12\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary12-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalking with Sister Eliza, we learned more about the history of the orpahange. An old couple lived in a shack, in the Sahar Village slums, just behind the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. The husband worked pumping water from the nearby well. He was somehow murdered on the Flight Kitchen’s property and his body was thrown in a well. The Kitchen compensated the wife by giving her property on which she then built a small slum house. When she died she left the house and property to the Handmaids of the Blessed Trinity. Eventually this property was expanded to become what is now the Sahar Village school and orphanage.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3734-8fa5-fcd9-014bbaa5d876\">Sister Eliza is about 50 years old but she looks like and has the energy of a much younger person. She came from Goa, India. When she was in college in Mumbai she studied Social Work in the slums and that is how she met Sister Paulette. Together they lived in the slums and were homeless until they were left a small home for their work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sister Eliza is very lively but at the same time very strict with the orphans. All the kids respect her. She is always smiling and seems very happy about her work. She stays busy all day long. In the morning she teaches 4th standard at the orphanage/school. In the afternoon she goes and teaches at a private school to earn money for the orphanage. Every Saturday night she leaves for Vasai to join Sister Paulette for the weekend. Between teaching, traveling back and forth between her three orphanages, and running the orphanages, she’s left with no time to herself.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary13\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary13-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSister Paulette worked with Mother Teresa for about twenty years until she became very sick and was sent to a hospital in Mumbai. She was paralyzed and the doctor told her she was going to be bedridden for life. Sister Paulette told us that Mother Mary appeared to her and told her to get up and go back to help people. Somehow she had a miraculous recovery and started working in the Sahar Village Slum. Today she spends most of her time at the Vasai Orphanage helping the 200 kids there. Sister Paulette told us that she believes in “fighting poverty by education”. She says: “Giving food helps for a day or two but educating saves an entire life.”\r\n\r\nAma is the caretaker of the Sahar Orphanage, she monitors the kids and she is like their mother. She gave up her own home and all personal belongings to come and live at the orphanage. She bathes the kids and feeds them and dresses them. She is always there for them and most of the village knows her. Her being there takes a lot of the burden off Sister Eliza and frees her up to be able to go to the other orphanages. Ama can be very strict at times, and she really knows how to keep the kids in order.

For breakfast they get one banana, one glass of milk, bread, butter, and jam. The bread, butter, and jam are donated by the Oberoi Flight Kitchen. Sister Eliza pays three Rupees for each kid to have an egg every morning.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary15\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary15-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they go to their classrooms until 1:00 p.m.  Ama then feeds them a lunch of dhal, rice, and water. After they eat, they get rest and play time. A tutor comes in the afternoon and works with them. After this they get a snack and have free time until Ama is ready to feed them dinner. Dinner consists of a glass of water, rice, and leftovers from lunch and breakfast.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary16\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary16-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn Mumbai kids are usually orphaned because either the parents are in jail, they’ve died, or the fathers left the mothers. Often the story is that one or both of the parents have died of AIDS. In cases where the father has left the mother, the mother is often left homeless or unable to cope with a full time job and care for a child.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary17\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary17-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce, we were walking home from a restaurant and we passed a frail middle aged woman holding a baby. She looked really sad. She was so desperate that she wasn’t begging for money, she was just standing in the middle of a street saying “khana” (food) to all passers. When we saw her, we gave her a bag of food that we got from the restaurant and she said: “God bless you.” Seeing people like that makes you want to give them everything you have because you know that they need it a lot more than you do.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary18\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary18-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-a7ee-8ff2-f70c3021eef4\">Poverty in India is EVERYWHERE. You could be inside the property of a five star, top line, hotel but as soon as you walk outside you would see a family bundled up on a few scraps of blankets. Or a mother trying to bathe her children in water from a pipe leak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19.jpg\"><img alt=\"diary19\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary19-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3736-fb97-ecd7-dd6ff730c291\">In America poor people on the streets are usually not literally “on the streets.” There are soup kitchens and food lines they can go to, there are people who set up organizations to shelter the homeless for a night or two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if a homeless person wanted to get off the streets, he/she probably could. In India, we did not see soup kitchens or “shelter for the poor” organizations; people are pretty much on their own. There are whole families living under a lean-to they’ve set up with scraps of blankets and wood. We saw a family</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6910ac3f-3737-1e3a-f7ca-68ab726c3003\">bathing in water from a sewage leak right on a busy traffic road, and cooking in a tin can over a small fire. These families don’t have enough money to send their kids to school, and they’re too busy trying to get food to even think about education.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[sectiontitle]Thursday, December 17, 2009[/sectiontitle]</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-92 alignnone\" alt=\"diary20\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary20-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1e-85b8-0f6e-6c08da776bc0\">At the Vasai Orphanage we saw that almost every kid had a skin infection on their legs and arms and other parts of the body. My dad sent pictures to an infection specialist at the University of Michigan and he wrote back with helpful advice to have one child with the infection tested at a local hospital.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yesterday we took an orphan to Holy Spirit Hospital in Mumbai hoping to get some tests done. The hospitals in India are very different from American hospitals. There was a huge line of about forty people all waiting to get their papers and to get checked by just one doctor. When we finally got to see the doctor, he told us what we already thought- the orphan had scabies and bacteria infections of the skin. He did not allow any tests to be done.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My dad became friends with a pharmacist nearby where we were staying. When the pharmacist heard what we were doing he said that he would give us medicine at the best price he could. We purchased enough medicine to treat all the orphans at both Vasai and Sahar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448\" alt=\"DSCF7056 cropped (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7056-cropped-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"429\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We spent a lot of time making charts of which children should take what doses of each medicine. On the last day, my dad weighed all the kids at the Sahar orphanage to make it easier for Sister Eliza to distribute the medication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-475\" alt=\"DSCF7662 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7662-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a>           <a style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\" href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"diary21\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary21-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be1f-4aba-c7c3-ce380f6890fd\">At Vasai all the orphans and caretakers bathe with water from a very shallow well. The well is covered by a wire dome. Sister Eliza told us that the kids sometimes misbehaved and threw toothbrushes and spit in the well. Sometimes they even urinated in the well. The kids don\'t have parents to discipline them and Sisters Eliza and Paulette are doing the best they can. The well is also located a few feet away from the pit toilets and we are worried that when it rains there is cross-contamination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We talked to the Sisters about our concerns with the current water situation and they said that they were uncomfortable with it also. They have paid a man to go down and clean out the well and they put a solid cover over the well. They also built a locked fence around the well so no kids can get through.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this is a good short term solution to the water problem, in monsoon season, there is going to be a lot of cross contamination and the water will become filthy again. . They have been thinking about it for a while and they both thought that the best idea would be to get a solar powered water boiler installed. Getting and installing this boiler will cost 150,000 rupees (the equivalent of a little over 3,000 U.S. dollars). Our short term goal is to raise enough money to buy this boiler for the orphanage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-2889-abfd-6562625193b9\">Today is our last day in Mumbai. We are taking a train to Vadodara to visit my dad\'s family. We are very glad to have had the chance to work at these orphanages.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95\" alt=\"diary23\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary23-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4d8822e0-be20-7c6d-80ed-f258b5054a58\">At times working at the orphanages was REALLY frustrating. The Orphans would start fighting for attention while we were talking to other kids and grabbing things from other kid’s hands. But at the end of every day at the orphanage, when they were all waving bye to us and walking us to the door shouting “good-bye Dee-Dee” (goodbye big sister) I felt good because I knew that the orphans were really happy. Seeing new people who wanted to help them was a big treat for them.  I was glad that I wasn’t just out seeing the Taj-ma-hal or some other attraction; instead, I was finally doing something that helped someone else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-96\" alt=\"diary24\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/diary24-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing this blog has been hard work because we are always doing it at the end of the day when we are exhausted and jet-lagged. I just want to go to sleep but my dad drags me down to the hotel lobby and asks to use the manager’s computer for a while. We go through all the pictures from the day, select the few we actually want to keep, and match them with things that had happened that day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After volunteering only for one week I have become amazed that the Sisters have devoted their whole lives to doing this work. It’s REALLY HARD. They have given up everything in their lives to help the orphans and their whole lives revolve around them. The only reason they do ANYTHING is for the orphans. They are so self-less and devoted, and not many people are like them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-479\" alt=\"DSCF7235 (Mobile)\" src=\"http://www.vitalypeker.com/handmaids/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/DSCF7235-Mobile.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"320\" /></a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although this blog is for memories and for showing others how different lives are in the slums in India, it is also to raise money. The Sisters have a wish-list of things they can’t afford. The solar-water boiler for the Vasai orphanage is something we’ve seen that they really need and there is NO way that they are going to get this without donors. Our goal is to raise $3500 for this project.
